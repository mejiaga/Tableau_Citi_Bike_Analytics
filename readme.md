# Tableau Assignment - Citi Bike Analytics

  
## Task

The task in this project is to aggregate the data found in the **Citi Bike Trip History Logs** to build a data dashboard that can answer the following questions:  

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown?

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? 

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

* What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

* What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

* What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan? 

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?
